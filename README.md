# whyql
whyql is a random experiment inspired by graphql and my desire to find something better than rest.

```
I once had a dream. In it, frontends and backends didn't have to rely on 
different things to achieve the same. It was a beautiful dream. Where we
could simply query for data and be done with a multitude of URIs that
ultimately ended in non-sense.

This is my take on this dream. It is imperfect. Idealistic. And totally wrong
for you. Do try it. Might inspire you to do better and fix this problem
once and for all.
